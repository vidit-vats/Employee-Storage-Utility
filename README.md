# Data-Storage-Utility

## Project Description

This utility emulates the behaviour of a DBMS software. It can store data of any entity in structured manner as is done by the DB Softwares

For Simplicity purpose, we are currently maintaining data of the Employees here that are having attributes as Employee ID, Name and Age.

## Assumption
* We are assuming Employee ID as primary key of the DB prior to runtime.

## Operations Allowed
1. Inserting Record in the Table.
2. Updating a Record.
3. Deleting a Record.
4. Viewing Records.

## Compiling the Program

Type ```c++ main.cc``` OR ```c++ -o name_of_executable main.cc```. This will create a target executable `a.out` OR `name_of_executable` on Unix-Based Systems like Linux or Mac. 

To run it, simple type: `./a.out` OR `./name_of_executable`
